At Solar System Express (Sol-x) we decided to revolutionize the high-level prototyping experience. Our efficient open source software controls all our open source hardware, creating a high level hardware API. The large and open source Object Exchange (OBEX) allows for the easy addition of software functions for the GDB.  The GDB rich design capabilities will empower engineers, designers, teachers, students and small businesses to create in an environment limited only by their imaginations. Like the Arduino, it operates across- platforms (Microsoft, Linux, Mac) and yet provides an unparalleled intuitive programming environments for beginners and professionals alike.
