Spin code for PongSats
===

At PongSat Parts (PSP) we decided to revolutionize the high-level prototyping experience. Our efficient open source software controls all our open source hardware, creating a high level hardware API. The large and open source Object Exchange (OBEX) allows for the easy addition of software functions for PSP kits. The Propeller Mini's rich design capabilities will empower engineers, designers, teachers, students and small businesses to create in an environment limited only by their imaginations. Like the Arduino, PSP kits  operates across- platforms (Microsoft, Linux, Mac).
